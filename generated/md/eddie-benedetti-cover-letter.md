Dear **[HIRING MANAGER NAME / Hiring Manager / Hiring Team]**,**

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **[POSITION TITLE]** position at **[COMPANY NAME]**. With over 18 years of experience as a Software Engineer, including leadership roles and expertise in modern full-stack development, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Throughout my career, I have built and maintained enterprise-level web applications that have transformed business operations. At Bond-Pro, I led the frontend architecture for a new Home Warranty application, strategically introducing modern technologies while maintaining system stability. This experience, combined with my recent work at Thinkbean where I built a video conferencing platform from scratch using React, Next.js, and AWS services, demonstrates my ability to deliver scalable solutions in fast-paced environments.

My technical expertise spans the full development stack, from frontend frameworks like React, AngularJS, and Next.js to backend technologies including Node.js, Express, C#, and both SQL and NoSQL databases. I am particularly passionate about leveraging modern tools and practices—including AI-powered development tools like Cursor and Claude—to accelerate development cycles while maintaining high code quality.

Beyond technical skills, I bring proven leadership experience. As a Team Lead at OneTouch Direct, I managed a team of developers, significantly improved team velocity, and established best practices that are still in use today. I excel at mentoring junior developers, collaborating in Agile/Scrum environments, and translating complex business requirements into elegant technical solutions.

I am drawn to **[COMPANY NAME]** because **[CUSTOMIZE: Mention something specific about the company/role that interests you]**. I believe my combination of technical expertise, leadership experience, and passion for building innovative solutions aligns perfectly with your needs.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills can contribute to **[COMPANY NAME]**'s continued success. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Eddie Benedetti
